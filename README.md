Programs written for analysis and presentation of experimental data obtained throughout
completion of the [PHYS 128Al] - Advanced Laboratory Methods course at UCSB

1. fitcheck.py
  - functions calculating the wavelength of a coherent laser source,
    as well as the refraction index of ambient air and a glass plate.
    measurements were made using a Michelson interferometer.

2. MuonFluxEXP.py
  - functions calculating the flux of atmospheric muons at different angles from the zenith.
    includes error propagation/analysis, residuals,
    custom function fitting, statistical data interpretation, and visualization.

3. microoptics.py
  - functions aimed at precisely calculating the wavelength of a microwave pulse
    measured using a variety of experimental techniques. includes function fitting,
    residuals, error analysis, and visualization.
